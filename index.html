  <h4>1:05 A.M.</h4>
  <p class="blog-post">Today I started developing my blog post website with the guidance of The Complete 2022 Web Devlopment Bootcamp by
    Dr. Angela Yu. So far so good. Dr. Yu does a fantastic job of breaking down the fundamental <strong>elements</strong> of an HTML document.
    Mostly this course has been a refresher from what I learned over a year ago. However, I was pleasantly surprised with the attention to detail.
    For instance, I'd forgetten that the additional information to modify an element was called attributes. The horizontal rule element was also
    new for me. That's an excellent example of a self-closing tag. Definitely, a nice touch when you are creating a webpage without the use of CSS.
    Feeling a bit sleepy now. I'll wrap this lesson up and wind down with a couple of chapters of Sepulturum: A Warhammer Horror Novel by Nick Kyme.

  <h4>10:38 P.M.</h4>
  <p class="blog-post">Happy Veterans Day! My employer honored me with a recognition of the completion of my apprenticeship program. I've not felt that close to a
    company since my days working in the theatre and when I was on active duty. The comradery at my new job is powerful and appreciated. Today was
    a celebration and a respite from my normal duties. I took some time to work on my Linux+ certification studies and to further my Web Dev Course
    training. As part of that training, my task is to add unordered and ordered lists as well as an image to my page. Starting with the lists, I thought
    it might be fun for me to create a list of the Warhammer Novels that I own, yet haven't read. Just some light shaming on my page to encourage me to
    finish what I've started.</p>
  <a href="my-warhammer-library.html"><strong>Warhammer Books to Read Next</strong></a>
  <p class="blog-post">Well, that was eye-opening. Sobering to go through all of the things I said I would finish. That's what I want this blog to be about. Finish
    things! I want to finish things. This blog will hold myself accountable by putting out to anyone who cares to read this what my goals and intentions
    are. Typhus, Herald of the Plague God has entered the picture. Getting the image to fit was a pain. First, I actually needed an image to put on my
    blog. I decided against my own image for now since I've been procrastinating on a haircut. Notably, Warhammer keeps popping up, I thought it fitting to
    upload an image of a model in which I was proud of the paint job. Second, my iPhone save the files in HEIC format. Ideally, the image format would be
    PNG. A quick hop over to <a href="https://convertio.co/">convertio.io</a> saved the day. Third, the image was massive. Almost 8MBs! Fortunately, a quick
    Google search told me to use Preview, a standard application of MacOS, to resize. </p>

  <h4>12:02 A.M.</h4>
  <p class="blog-post">I'm approaching the end of Section 2 of the Web Dev BootCamp Course and my final task is to create a second HTML webpage for my site. I'm thinking it
    could be cool to break off my Warhammer Books to Read Next into a seperate page. Additional, I want to catalogue all of the Warhammer books
    I've already finished. Renaming this section seems appropriate. My Warhammer Library sounds better. Looking at my page, the hyperlink should be
    moved to the top of the page. Keeping it buried in the blog posts doesn't make sense to me. On second thought, I'll keep a link in both places. Leaving
    the link in the blog post prevents the reader from needing to jump around the webpage. Turns out I haven't read as many books as I'd thought. I'll
    definitely finish <em>Sepulturum</em> tonight. Monday nights, I head to my local flagship gamestore for a weekly painting meetup. Curious to see if
    anyone would be interested in forming a Warhammer Bookclub. That would be cool!</p>
  <p class="blog-post">I noticed that if I have an anchor element and nest a heading element inside, the area to click to the next page stretches accross the entire page.
    Definitely don't want that! I've switched from Heading 4 to Strong. The aesthetic is similar, but the functionality is optimized.</p>

  <p class="blog-post">Went out to celebrate my friend's birthday. That was a nice break from the grind of work. Today, I need to construct a table in HTML, but I'm not sure
    what to put into it. What would I need a table for anyway? The Web Dev Course suggests creating a CV page, but I'd say my Linkedin has that covered. Maybe I
    can do a "Pile of Shame" list. Later I can add the models I've already painted. Side note: I've finished <em>Sepulturum</em> and started reading <em>Bloodlines</em>.
    I'll add the Pile of Shame section at the top of the page as well as in the blog post as I've done with the previous section.</p>
  <a href="pile-of-shame.html"><strong>Pile of Shame</strong></a>
  <p class="blog-post">All models catalogued. Going to my weekly painting group has been putting a nice dent in the backlog. Ideally, I'd like to be totally caught up on my models before
    I purchase new ones. The Cadia Stands boxset is ready for reservations and I feel a smidge of guilt about wanting it so badly. For a small HTML coding challenge, I need
    to make a small table with emojis in it. One row with two cells, however each cell needs to have two pieces of data in it.</p>
  <table border="1">
    <thead>
      <th>Physical Book</th>
      <th>Audio Book</th>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>
          <table cellspacing="10">
            <tr>
              <td><em>Sepulturum</em></td>
              <td>⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td><em>Pariah</em></td>
              <td>⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️</td>
            </tr>
          </table>
        </td>
        <td>
          <table cellspacing="10">
            <tr>
              <td><em>Dark Imperium</em></td>
              <td>⭐️⭐️⭐️</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td><em>Horus Rising</em></td>
              <td>No Rating</td>
            </tr>
          </table>
        </td>
      </tr>

  <h4>3:00 P.M.</h4>
  <p class="blog-post">Last night was a blast! I caught up with a friend at an arcade. Drinks were consumed and games were played. We also made some new friends. A group of people noticed
    that I was a magician, so I waved them over and showed them some tricks. We ended up hanging out until closing time. Afterwards, we topped off the night with some
    Whataburger. A Texas traditon. Today I more of a recovery day for me. Laundry needs done and had to tidy up my apartment. I'm doing some decorating with decks of
    playing cards and this UFO leviating speaker that was a gift from work. Definitely, one of the cooler things I've ever received from a workplace. The next lesson in
    the Web Dev Course asks me to create a form for my site. Adding a book recommendation form could be a could addition to the My Warhammer Library page. Form is done. It's
    fucking ugly, but functional. I'm worried about the lack of input validation though. I sincerely hope that the JavaScript section of the course address this. Otherwise, my
    form could be exploited using some simple XSS.</p>
  <h4>4:57 P.M.</h4>
  <p class="blog-post">This blog is now live! For now, I'm gonna host it on GitHub. Later down the road I want to host the site myself. I'll look into hosting a website via a spare Raspberry
    Pi that I own. One of my cybersecurity instructors assured me that the process isn't that complicated. Playing around with the color palette is fun, yet challenging. Not
    that coding it is difficult, but I'm having trouble deciding on a palatte that matches my site best.</p>

  <h4>11:15 P.M.</h4>
  <p class="blog-post">Busy day! Had my painting group this evening, but I totally forgot to ask if anyone would be interested in forming a book club. At least I had fun and made some progress
    on my Orks. I made some new friends and we exchanged information. Maybe I could cajole them into their first game of Warhammer 40000. The couple both collect their own armies
    so lots of possibilites for battle reports. I had to do some light photo editing for some headshots I took last Friday. Goodness, was my SD card filled! I probably cleared out 500
    or more pictures that were of lower quality or I'd already archived. That's why I'm so late to writing this evening. Gotta get back into CSS. Just learned about adding class to my
    HTML elements so I can affect them with CSS. Very cool and granular.</p>

  <h4>10:18 P.M.</h4>
  <p class="blog-post">I've spent entirely too much time trying to create a favicon for my blog. Nothing I've done thus far looks appealing to me. I'll keep fiddling around with it, but
    for now I just need to move on to the next step. Admittedly, I haven't done any work on models today. Sluggish is how I'd describe my energy today. Perhaps this upcoming vacation will
    do me some good. Finally got a favicon that I like. By working smarter and not harder, I remembered that I'd made a pixel art version of myself a long time ago. I went into Aseprite
  and removed the head so I could fit it into a 16x16 image. It's really cute!</p>
